                  one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to
                  participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death

                  Harry Potter is about to start his fifth year at Hogwarts
                  School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unlike most schoolboys,
                  Harry never enjoys his summer holidays, but this summer is
                  even worse than usual. The Dursleys, of course, are making his
                  life a misery, but even his best friends, Ron and Hermione,
                  seem to be neglecting him. Harry has had enough. He is
                  beginning to think he must do something, anything, to change
                  his situation, when the summer holidays come to an end in a
                  very dramatic fashion. What Harry is about to discover in his
                  new year at Hogwarts will turn his world upside down...

                <div class="title">Pride and Prejudice</div>
                <div class="desc">
                  Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has
                  remained one of the most popular novels in the English
                  language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own
                  darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet,
                  "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The
                  romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud
                  beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized
                  sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her
                  characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and
                  intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners
                  of Regency England.

                <div class="title">To Kill a Mockingbird</div>
                <div class="desc">
                  The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern
                  town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. "To Kill A
                  Mockingbird" became both an instant bestseller and a critical
                  success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win
                  the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy
                  Award-winning film, also a classic. Compassionate, dramatic,
                  and deeply moving, "To Kill A Mockingbird" takes readers to
                  the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience,
                  kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now
                  with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty
                  languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims
                  universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be
                  a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of
                  American literature.

                <div class="desc">
                  It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath.
                  Death has never been busier, and will be busier still. By her
                  brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks
                  up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The
                  Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it
                  is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair
                  with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her
                  accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is
                  stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's
                  library, wherever there are books to be found. But these are
                  dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in
                  their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed
                  down. In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity,
                  award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most
                  enduring stories of our time.

                  First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of
                  him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that
                  thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and
                  irrevocably in love with him. Deeply seductive and
                  extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with
                  bite.
